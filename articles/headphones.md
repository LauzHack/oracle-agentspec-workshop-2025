# Deep Focus: Auris Studio Pro Headphones

Topic: Headphone Review

## Build and comfort
The clamping force is gentle and the pads breathe well during long sessions.
The headband distributes weight evenly; I could wear these for hours without hot spots.

## Sound
Balanced tuning with a slight warmth in the mids. Vocals sit forward without sibilance.
Bass is controlled rather than boomy; sub-bass is present but not exaggerated.
The soundstage isn’t gigantic, but imaging is precise enough for mixing and focused listening.

## Features
- Detachable cable with reliable connectors
- Fold-flat cups for backpacks
- No active noise cancellation, but passive isolation is solid

## Verdict
For study sessions and hobbyist production, the Auris Studio Pro are a joy.
They won’t please bass-heads, but if you want detail and comfort, they’re excellent.
